 * 1.  **License.**
 *     1. Grant of License. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Salesforce grants Licensee a non-transferable,
 *        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use the Software for Licensee's internal purposes and for distribution with Licensee's

 *        and does not include any Software.
 *     1. Restrictions. As a condition of this license, Licensee will not (a) decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the
 *        Software or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or programming interfaces

 *        restrictions and then upon notice to Salesforce); (b) sell, sublicense, rent, lease or use the Software (or any portion thereof) for
 *        time sharing, hosting, service provider or like purposes; (c) distribute Licensee's App with Software when Software provides the main
 *        functionality of the distribution; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the

 *        information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) from any source relating to the Software.
 *     1. Open Source Code. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of third-party "open
 *        source" software licenses (" **Open Source Software**"). To the extent required by any license that accompanies any Open Source
 *        Software, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Software,
 *        including, without limitation, any provisions governing access to source code, modification or reverse engineering.
 * 1.  **Ownership.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except for the limited license rights expressly provided
 *     herein, Salesforce and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest (including, without limitation, all patent,
 *     copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Software and all copies, modifications and
 *     derivative works thereof (including any changes that incorporate any of Licensee's Feedback). Licensee acknowledges that it is obtaining
 *     only a limited license right to the Software and that irrespective of any use of the words "purchase", "sale" or like terms hereunder,
 *     no ownership rights are being conveyed to Licensee under this Agreement or otherwise. If Licensee elects to provide any suggestions,
 *     comments, improvements, ideas or other feedback to Salesforce related to the Software (collectively, " **Feedback**"), Licensee agrees
 *     that Salesforce will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute and exploit the Feedback provided to it as
 *     Salesforce sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind. All rights not granted by Salesforce are reserved. Licensee
 *     retains all rights to Licensee's App.
 * 1.  **Term of Agreement.**
 *
 *     1. Term. This Agreement is effective until terminated (the " **Term**"). Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party:
 *        (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach; (b) ceases
 *        operation without a successor or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement,
 *        composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60)
 *        days). Termination is not an exclusive remedy and the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement will be without
 *        prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.
 *
 *     2. Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall cease all use of and destroy all copies of the

 *     WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.
 * 1.  **No Support or Maintenance.** Salesforce has no obligation to, and will not, provide support, updates, bug fixes, maintenance releases
 *     or new versions of the Software under this Agreement.

 *
 *     1. Consequential Damages Waiver. SALESFORCE (AND ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR
 *        ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
 *        INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.
 *
 *     2. Liability Cap. SALESFORCE AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT
 *        EXCEED $1.
 *
 *     3. Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose. The parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 6
 *        apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will
 *        survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
 *
 * 1.  **Export Compliance.** Licensee acknowledges that the Software may be subject to export restrictions by the United States government and
 *     import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Licensee shall not, and shall not allow any third party to, remove or export from
 *     the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof in violation of any export
 *     or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority.
 * 1.  **General.**
 *
 *     1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Licensee may not
 *        assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Salesforce and any attempt to do so will be void. Salesforce may assign
 *        this Agreement upon written notice to Licensee. All rights, benefits and protections granted to Salesforce pursuant to this Agreement
 *        extend to its affiliates.
 *
 *     2. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or
 *        invalid, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in effect.
 *
 *     3. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States,
 *        without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale
 *        of Goods. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof is California and United States

 *        fees and costs in connection with such action.
 *
 *     5. Notices and Reports. Any notice or report hereunder shall be in writing. If to Salesforce, such notice or report shall be sent to
 *        Salesforce at the address above to the attention of "Legal Department". If to Licensee, such notice or report shall be sent to the

 *        duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or
 *        exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative
 *        on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.
 *
 *     7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes
 *        and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No
 *        provision of any purchase order or in any other business form employed by Licensee will supersede the terms and conditions of this
 *        Agreement, and any such document issued by a party hereto relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and
 *        shall have no legal effect.
 *
 *     8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint
 *        venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or

 *        or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of
 *        the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or
